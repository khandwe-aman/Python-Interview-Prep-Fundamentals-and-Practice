Code-
n = int(input("enter any number:"))
temp = 0
for i in range(2,n//2):
  if n%2 == 0:
    temp = 1
    break
if temp == 1:
  print(n,"is a prime number")
else:
  print(n,"is not a prime number")
Explanation-
Here first of all we are taking n which is the number to be checked as an input then we are defining two variables i.e i and temp. Then we are using a for and if loop to check 
if the number entered i.e n is divisible by any number in range 2 to n//2 here we are taking the range from 2 bcz every number is divisible by 1 so we are starting our range 
from 2 and running it till n//2 which gives us the quotient i.e maximum value till we will check. Then we apply a if condition to check n%i i.e if n is divisible by any number 
in range 2 to n//2 if it t is then we are assigning temp =1 and then we are breaking the loop. Now after that we are again applying a if else condition to check if temp ==1 or 
not if it is equal to 1 then the nummber is not prime bcz it is divisible by number other than 1 and itself and else the number is prime number.
