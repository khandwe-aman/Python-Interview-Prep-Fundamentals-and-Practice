Code-
first,second=0,1
n = int(input("please give a number for fibonacci series : "))
print("fibonacci series are : ")
for i in range(0,n):
    if i<=1:
        result=i
    else:
      result = first + second;
      first = second;
      second = result;
    print(result)
print('and the fibbonaci value of the number',n,'is',result)

Explanation-
Before moving on to the logic part t=lets first talk about the fibonacci series. Fibonacci series is nothing but just the sum of previous two numbers. It starts with 0,1 and it goes on like-
0
1
0+1 = 1
1+1 = 2
1+2 = 3
2+3 = 5 and so on.....
Now moving on to the logic part here we are first assigning two variables i.e first and second with value 0 and 1 and then we are asking form user the value of n for the number 
till which he/she wants the fibonacci series. Then we are running a for loop for i in range 0 to n and in that we are using if else condition, if value of n is less than or 
equal to 1 then we will get the result i itslef else result will be the sum of first and second term then we assign first term the value of second term and then find the next 
second term and so on untill second term = result. After that we are simply returning two values one is series and another one is the value for that number. For getting the 
series we are taking result inside the for loop and for value we are taking result outside the loop.
