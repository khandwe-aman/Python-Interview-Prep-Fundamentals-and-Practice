Code-
n = int(input('please enter a number: '))
sum = 0
org_n = n
while n>0:
  last_digit = n%10
  sum = sum + pow(last_digit,3)
  n = n//10
if sum == org_n:
  print(org_n,' is an armstrong number.')
else:
  print(org_n,' is not an armstrong number.')

Explanation-
Before going to logic part first lets understand what an armstrong number is-
Armstrong number is a number which is equal to the sum of cube of its digits.
For example- 153 is armstrong number bcz-
1^3 = 1
5^3 = 125
3^3 = 27
Now 1+125+27=153

So here in this code also like every other code we will ask for an input from user and store it in n then we will define two variables sum to store the sum of cube of digits 
and org_n to store the original value of n. After that we will apply while loop for n>0 where just like our reversing the number code we will first find the individual digits 
using last_digit=n%10 and when we will add it to sum but by using pow function bcz we want the cube of individual digits then we will do n = n//10 to find tens hundred digit. 
After that we will check if sum == org_n if it is so then the number will be armstrong number else it is not an armstrong number.
Here we are using org_n bcz in while loop the value of n will get zero so we need to sotre the original value of n some where so we are storing it in org_n.
